Determining Verlet buffer for a tolerance of 0.005 kJ/mol/ps at 310 K

Calculated rlist for 1x1 atom pair-list as 1.296 nm, buffer size 0.096 nm

Set rlist, assuming 4x4 atom pair-list, to 1.223 nm, buffer size 0.023 nm

Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup

Reading Coordinates, Velocities and Box size from old trajectory

Will read whole trajectory

Using frame at t = 125 ps

Starting time for run is 0 ps
Calculating fourier grid dimensions for X Y Z
Using a fourier grid of 60x60x60, spacing 0.119 0.119 0.119

Estimate for the relative computational load of the PME mesh part: 0.21

This run will generate roughly 7 Mb of data
