Executable:   /apps/gromacs-2021.4/bin/gmx_mpi
Data prefix:  /apps/gromacs-2021.4
Working dir:  /home/giacomo.marcon/toCluster/07_npt_7
Command line:
  gmx_mpi mdrun -s ./step5_prod_7.tpr -cpi step5_prod_7.cpt -maxh 5.95 -deffnm step5_prod_7 -append

Compiled SIMD: AVX_512, but for this host/run AVX2_256 might be better (see
log).
Reading file ./step5_prod_7.tpr, VERSION 2021.4 (single precision)
Changing nstlist from 20 to 80, rlist from 1.223 to 1.321

Using 25 MPI processes

Non-default thread affinity set, disabling internal thread affinity

Using 1 OpenMP thread per MPI process

starting mdrun 'Title'
50000000 steps, 100000.0 ps (continuing from step 41630160,  83260.3 ps).

Step 48735040: Run time exceeded 5.890 hours, will terminate the run within 80 steps


Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was turned on during the run due to measured imbalance.
 Average load imbalance: 2.0%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 90%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 1.8%.
 Steps where the load balancing was limited by -rdd, -rcon and/or -dds: X 0 % Y 0 %
 Average PME mesh/force load: 0.659
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 6.3 %

NOTE: 6.3 % performance was lost because the PME ranks
      had less work to do than the PP ranks.
      You might want to decrease the number of PME ranks
      or decrease the cut-off and the grid spacing.
