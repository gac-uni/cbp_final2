2500000 steps,   5000.0 ps.

Step 1422100: Run time exceeded 5.890 hours, will terminate the run within 100 steps


Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was off during the run due to low measured imbalance.
 Average load imbalance: 0.3%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 96%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 0.3%.
 Average PME mesh/force load: 0.389
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 11.7 %

NOTE: 11.7 % performance was lost because the PME ranks
      had less work to do than the PP ranks.
      You might want to decrease the number of PME ranks
      or decrease the cut-off and the grid spacing.
