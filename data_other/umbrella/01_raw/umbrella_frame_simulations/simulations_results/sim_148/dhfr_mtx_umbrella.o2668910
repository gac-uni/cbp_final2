Velocities were taken from a Maxwell distribution at 310 K

Determining Verlet buffer for a tolerance of 0.005 kJ/mol/ps at 310 K

Calculated rlist for 1x1 atom pair-list as 1.496 nm, buffer size 0.096 nm

Set rlist, assuming 4x4 atom pair-list, to 1.422 nm, buffer size 0.022 nm

Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup
Calculating fourier grid dimensions for X Y Z
Using a fourier grid of 60x60x160, spacing 0.114 0.114 0.110

Estimate for the relative computational load of the PME mesh part: 0.17

This run will generate roughly 32 Mb of data
