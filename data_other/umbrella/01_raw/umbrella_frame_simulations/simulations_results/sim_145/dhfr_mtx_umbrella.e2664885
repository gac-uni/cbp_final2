Reading file ./mdrun.tpr, VERSION 2021.4 (single precision)
Changing nstlist from 20 to 100, rlist from 1.422 to 1.537

Using 20 MPI processes

Non-default thread affinity set, disabling internal thread affinity

Using 1 OpenMP thread per MPI process

starting mdrun 'Title'
2500000 steps,   5000.0 ps (continuing from step 2446000,   4892.0 ps).

Writing final coordinates.


Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was off during the run due to low measured imbalance.
 Average load imbalance: 1.0%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 92%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 0.9%.
 Average PME mesh/force load: 0.677
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 5.9 %

NOTE: 5.9 % performance was lost because the PME ranks
      had less work to do than the PP ranks.
      You might want to decrease the number of PME ranks
      or decrease the cut-off and the grid spacing.
